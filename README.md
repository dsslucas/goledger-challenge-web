# Challenge - GoLedger
The challenge set forth by GoLedger company requires the implementation of a system capable of performing CRUD operations on their API.  

## Packages

 - React.js (version 18.3.1);
 - React Router V7;
 - TypeScript;
 - TailwindCSS (styling);
 - Webpack-env (for renderize random image);
 - Axios (requests to API);
 - Sweetalert2 (popup for show response message).
 
## Instructions
 - Clone this repository;
 - Access the cloned project in the terminal and type `npm i` for download the dependencies;
 - After, start using the command `npm start`.

## Features

### Home

On the **Home** page, users can view a list of artists, albums, songs, and playlists. They can access these items and also create new ones—be it an artist, album, song, or playlist—provided they are in the selected category.

### Artist

On the **Artist** page, users can:

 - Edit the artist country;
 - View the list of albuns and their songs;
 - Add new album;
 - Remove individual songs and/or album;
 - Delete the artist along with its albums and songs.

### Album

On the **Album** page, users can:

-   Edit the album's release year.
-   View the list of songs associated with the album.
-   Add new songs.
-   Remove individual songs.
-   Delete the album along with its associated songs.

On the **Home (option Album)** or **Artist** page, users have the option to add a new album. During album creation, they can choose to include selected songs immediately, or they can create an empty album, making the addition of songs optional.

After an album is created, users can still add more songs. In this case, the system retrieves the songs already associated with the album and combines them with any newly added tracks.

When deleting a sound, its references are automatically removed from the album and any playlists to which it is linked.

### Song
At **Home (option Song)** or **Album** page, the user can create new songs, **since them were associated with an album**.

If the user access the Song option at Home page, on click, the user will be redirected for Album where that song were associated.

### Playlist
On the **Playlist** page, users can:

-   View the name of playlist, if its private (within change option);
-   View the list of songs associated, each of them within album and artist name;
-   Add new songs;
-   Remove individual songs.
-   Delete the playlist along with its associated songs.

On the **Home (option Playlist)** or **Playlist** page, upon clicking the 'Add' button, a modal appears prompting for the required data. Additionally, the modal may include an interactive table listing previously recorded sounds, each linked to a specific artist and album.

## Screens
These are the project pages, with responsiveness provided by TailwindCSS.

## Observations

**Images**
For represent images for artists, albums, songs, and playlists, **I have adopted the use of random images generated by Meta's artificial intelligence**, strictly for non-commercial purposes.

**Artist, Album and Playlist pages**
Both of that pages have using reusable component with similar styling, opening possibilities for easy and fast maintenance.

**Delete Operations**
I chose not to use the "cascade" attribute for delete operations, as this feature deletes all records linked to the assetType. For example, deleting a song from an album could unintentionally remove it from all associated playlists. The same principle applies to the deletion of artists and albums.

To delete an artist, album, or song, specific validations are performed to ensure individualized removal of songs, albums, or artists. After the deletion process is complete, the system redirects the user to the "/home" page.
